# .gitignore Configuration

This .gitignore file is configured for a Flutter project and includes:

## Flutter/Dart specific ignores:
- Build artifacts and generated files
- Platform-specific generated files
- Flutter plugins and dependencies
- App icons generated by flutter_launcher_icons

## Development environment ignores:
- IDE files (IntelliJ, VS Code)
- OS-specific files (.DS_Store, etc.)
- Log files and temporary files
- Environment variables

## Platform-specific ignores:
- iOS: Xcode files, Pods, derived data
- Android: Gradle files, build artifacts
- Web: Generated plugin registrant
- Windows/Linux/macOS: Platform-specific generated files

## Security ignores:
- Firebase configuration files
- Keystore files
- Environment variables

This ensures that only source code and necessary configuration files are tracked in version control.
